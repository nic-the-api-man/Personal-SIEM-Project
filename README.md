# Personal-SIEM-Project
Creating a SIEM to match my personal cybersecurity needs using Wazuh.

## Objective

This personal SIEM project aimed to create a security measure to monitor my own security environment between two devices. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies. Most importantly, it is also aimed at taking control of my own security. Also special shoutout to MyDFIR on youtube for providing a great tutorial on this specific project.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Risk management
- Threat intelligence and threat driven testing

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
