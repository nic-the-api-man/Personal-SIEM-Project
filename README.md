Creating a SIEM to match my personal cybersecurity needs using Wazuh.

## Objective

This personal SIEM project aimed to create a security measure to monitor my own security environment between two devices. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies. Most importantly, it is also aimed at taking control of my own security.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Risk management
- Threat intelligence and threat driven testing

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
